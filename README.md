# MiniMax

Get possible min and max values on summing 4 of 6 numbers.
You are provided with six positive integers. Your objective is to determine the minimum and maximum values that can be obtained by summing exactly four out of the six integers. Print the resulting minimum and maximum values on a single line, separated by a space, as two long integers.

To achieve this, follow these steps:

Take any four numbers from the given set of six positive integers and calculate their sum.
Repeat this process for all possible combinations of four numbers.
Identify the smallest sum as the minimum value and the largest sum as the maximum value.
Print the calculated minimum and maximum values, ensuring they are represented as long integers and separated by a space.

**Important Note: **
Ensure that you save your solution before progressing to the next question and before submitting your answer.
